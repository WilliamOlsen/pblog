* Finish tasks

* Automatically open your agenda file every time you start Emacs
It's convenient for me to see my agenda file as soon as I open Emacs after logging on to my computer.  To do this, 
1. #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el
   #+END_SRC
2. Go to the end of this file. (Handy shortcut: C-end)
3. Add (find-file "~/todo.org")
4. Save with C-x C-s (save-buffer)

You can test it with M-x eval-buffer while looking at your ~/.emacs.d/init.el.  If it works, it should show your agenda file.

You have just written a little Emacs lisp.  Totally not scary.
