* How to use org and Jekyll
I want to write my blog posts (and most everything else) in org-mode.

* Why use Org-mode?
Only because it is the best.  I write my lecture notes in it, and then I export to LaTex where I do my final editing.

* Why use Jekyll?
There's only one reason: because it's the best. Duh.
