* Finish tasks

* Automatically open your agenda file every time you start Emacs
It's convenient for me to see my agenda file as soon as I open Emacs after logging on to my computer.  To do this, 
1. <code>C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>
2. Go to the end of this file. (Handy shortcut: <code>C-end</code>)
3. Add <code>(find-file "~/todo.org")</code>
4. Save with <code>C-x C-s</code> (save-buffer)

* Define shortcuts for managing TODO states
Now we want to put each of our tasks into 'states'.  My favorite states are
- todo
- in progress
- waiting
- canceled
- done
To see what this looks like

** INPROGRESS A task that I'm currently working on which is being clocked to see how long it's taking to do it.
