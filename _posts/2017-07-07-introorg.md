# Finish tasks

# Automatically open your agenda file every time you start Emacs

It's convenient for me to see my agenda file as soon as I open Emacs after logging on to my computer.  To do this, 

1.  <code>C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>
2.  Go to the end of this file. (Handy shortcut: <code>C-end</code>)
3.  Add <code>(find-file "~/todo.org")</code>
4.  Save with <code>C-x C-s</code> (save-buffer)

# Define shortcuts for managing TODO states

Now we want to put each of our tasks into 'states'.  My favorite states are

-   todo
-   in progress
-   waiting
-   canceled
-   done

To see what this looks like

## INPROGRESS A task that I'm currently working on which is being clocked to see how long it's taking to do it.
